Welcome to my Github page! 
I am Katie McCreedy, a PhD student and researcher in Population Health Sciences with a focus on Epidemiology at Northeastern University. My work is centered around the overdose crisis and overdose crisis policy, and I am a member of the Health in Justice Action Lab where I lead quantitative media analysis research teams. In addition to my research, I have worked as a Research Assistant at the Harvard Injury Control Center and have experience in clinical and teaching assistant roles. I am proficient in various data analysis tools such as R, Tableau, and Excel, and have completed relevant courses in advanced biostatistics, intermediate epidemiology, and population health. My passion for public health extends beyond my academic pursuits and I volunteer my time with organizations such as Peer Health Exchange and NY-NJ Trail Conference.
